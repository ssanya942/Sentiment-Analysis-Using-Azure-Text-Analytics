## Workshop Template

Welcome to the design template for the [Workshop-o-matic](presentation.pptx), a system designed to help Microsoft Student Ambassadors and their partners to create and deliver excellent technical workshops.

## Get started building a workshop

Start your course design process by reviewing this cheat sheet:
- [Workshop Cheat Sheet](cheat-sheet.md)

Then, design your workshop following the Understanding By Design Framework:

- [Workshop Designer](./workshop/workshop-designer.md)

Finally, build the workshop itself:

- [Workshop Template](./workshop/README.md)

Last, send a PR of your workshop to our workshop library for review, reuse and inclusion in the library, using [this repo's PR template](https://github.com/microsoft/workshop-library).
