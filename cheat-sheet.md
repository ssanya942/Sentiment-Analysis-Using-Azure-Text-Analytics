# Workshop Cheat Sheet

Here are the steps to take to create a workshop:

## Creation phase

1. Click the green 'Use this template' button to copy this repo to your own GitHub account.
1. Review the questions in the [workshop designer](../workshop/workshop-designer.md) file, documenting your plans for the workshop.
1. Build the workshop using the [lesson template](../workshop/README.md) files.
1. Build slides as a preliminary presentation to explain the desired outcomes of the workshop.
1. When you think the workshop is ready for inclusion into the library, please send a pull request back to this repo using the PR template. **Only include your edited workshop folder, including the workshop-designer document, in this PR**. A reviewer will be assigned to the workshop and will work with you to perfect it.

Have fun and thank you!
