## Pre-Learning

*Check out [Cognitive Services for Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/explore-natural-language-processing/)*

## Prerequisites

*For this workshop:*  <br> 
1. You need to have an Azure Account. You can get either the [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/?WT.mc_id=academic-49822-dmitryso) version or use the [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/?WT.mc_id=academic-49822-dmitryso) version <br>
2. You need to have working knowledge of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) on your local machine. Alternatively, you can locally install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and use it on [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or on [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)<br>


## What students will learn

In this workshop, students would learn to use Azure's Text Analytics service for performing a sentiment analysis on user data.

## Milestone 1: Getting and Understanding the Data
The data has been manually aggregated by collecting feedback from Azure users. Check out the [Data](https://github.com/ssanya942/Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Azure-Text-Analytics/tree/main/workshop/Data) folder to access feedback data segregated into 5 files: <br>
1. [AzComparison.txt](https://github.com/ssanya942/Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Azure-Text-Analytics/blob/main/workshop/Data/AzComparison.txt) contains a comparitive analysis of Azure with other cloud providers from the users' perspective. <br>
2. [AzEduhub.txt](https://github.com/ssanya942/Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Azure-Text-Analytics/blob/main/workshop/Data/AzEduhub.txt) contains the users' overall insights regarding Azure <br>
3. [AzNegative.txt](https://github.com/ssanya942/Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Azure-Text-Analytics/blob/main/workshop/Data/AzNegative.txt) contains the complaints users have against Azure <br>
4. [Azpositive.txt](https://github.com/ssanya942/Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Azure-Text-Analytics/blob/main/workshop/Data/Azpositive.txt) contains positive user reviews on Azure
5. [AzPMAdvice.txt](https://github.com/ssanya942/Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Azure-Text-Analytics/blob/main/workshop/Data/AzPMAdvice.txt) contains users' advice for Azure's Program Managers


> *If you are an Azure user, you could amplify our database of user feedback by filling up this [feedback form.](https://forms.office.com/r/M5EuyHbTB3) The required modifications would be made in the data in this repository itself.*
